Understanding LIFO and FIFO, Stacks, and Queues
LIFO and FIFO
LIFO
LIFO stands for Last In, First Out. It is a principle used in data structures where the last element added to a collection is the first one to be removed. Think of it like a stack of plates, where you always take the plate from the top.

FIFO
FIFO stands for First In, First Out. It is another principle used in data structures where the first element added is the first one to be removed. An analogy for FIFO is a queue of people waiting in line, where the first person in line is the first to proceed.

Stacks
A stack is a data structure that follows the LIFO principle. It has two main operations: push (to add an element to the top) and pop (to remove the element from the top). Stacks are often used in scenarios where the order of processing or handling data matters, like function calls, parsing expressions, and managing undo/redo functionality.

Queues
A queue is a data structure that follows the FIFO principle. It has two primary operations: enqueue (to add an element to the end) and dequeue (to remove the element from the front). Queues are commonly used in scenarios where tasks need to be processed in a sequential order, such as managing print jobs, task scheduling, and breadth-first search algorithms.

Common Implementations
Stacks
Array-based Implementation: Use an array to represent the stack.
Linked List Implementation: Use a linked list to represent the stack.
Queues
Array-based Implementation: Use an array to represent the queue.
Linked List Implementation: Use a linked list to represent the queue.
Common Use Cases
Stacks
Function Call Management: Used to keep track of function calls and local variables.
Expression Evaluation: Helps in evaluating expressions, especially in languages with postfix notation.
Undo/Redo Mechanisms: Useful for implementing undo and redo functionality in applications.
Queues
Task Scheduling: Manages tasks in the order they are received or scheduled.
Print Job Management: Prints documents in the order they are sent to the printer.
Breadth-First Search: Used in algorithms for exploring graphs level by level.
Proper Use of Global Variables
While global variables can be convenient, it's generally recommended to minimize their usage due to potential issues like naming conflicts and unintended side effects. When using global variables:

Choose meaningful and unique names to avoid conflicts.
Minimize the number of global variables to reduce complexity.
Clearly document the purpose and scope of each global variable.
Consider using encapsulation techniques, such as limiting their visibility with the static keyword or grouping them into a structure.
